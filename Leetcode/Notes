1. *list -> unpack list 
2. zip(*list) -> reverse 2D array 
3. hash function is builtin to python
4. Make sure hashmaps have same time for input and output
5. ^ is xor 
6. bin() to convert to binary
7. use .sort(key = lambda x: f(x)) to do custom sorting
8. A[::-1] for reversing a list
9. a.reverse() will reverse the list in place 
10. reversed(a) will return an iterator of the reversed list (but does not modify the list)
    -> the iterator will point to the original list
11. ```return``` is equivalent to ```return None``` if on a line by itself 
12. all() is helpful for verifying that a condition is satisfied throughout an array 
13. Assign multiple variables in one line with 
    ```x, y = 2, 3```
14. enumerate() is helpful for for loops 
15. dictionary comprehensions are great for problems requiring hashmaps

bytearray?
LCs with ()
