Problem Statement

Eric has four integers, a, b, c, and d.
Instantly, he wondered how many pairs of integers, (x, y), satisfy:

    x**2 + y**2 = (x*a) + (y*b)

where 1 <= x <= c and 1 <= y <= d.
Find and print the number of pairs that satisfy the above equation.
'''

# Solution:
#
# We begin with the linear diophantine equation ax + by = c
# we know this equation only has solutions if
# c is a multiple of gcd(a, b).
# This means that c can take on integer values
# n * gcd(a, b) for any given a, b
# In addition, we know
# if (x, y) is a solution, then the other solutions have the form (x + kv, y âˆ’ ku)
# where k is an arbitrary const, s.t.

# if (x,y) soln, all other solutions are of form (x + k*a/gcd(a,b), x + k*b/gcd(a,b))
#Therefore,

# We let w = gcd(a,b) euclidian alg

# (1) (x^2 + y^2) must be a multiple of w
# (2) Once we find solution (x, y),  all other solutions are of form (x + k*a/w, x + k*b/w)
